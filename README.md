Genetic parameters, breeding values and genomic prediction in R. One engine fits the
animal model and its close relatives: direct-maternal, sire and maternal-grandsire,
reaction norms, several traits and the single step. It fits them by AI-REML, or samples
them with a Gibbs sampler for Gaussian and binary traits. The numerics are written in
the package itself, in `src/`, and `R CMD INSTALL` compiles them. No separate binary, no
service, no run-time dependency.

## Installation

```r
# straight from GitHub with base R only; it compiles, so Windows needs Rtools and macOS
# the Xcode command-line tools. Downloading first keeps RStudio from trying to read the
# URL as a local file (harmless "tar.exe: Error opening archive" warnings otherwise).
f <- file.path(tempdir(), "BreedingR.tar.gz")
download.file("https://github.com/phyllype/BreedingR/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz", f,
              mode = "wb")
install.packages(f, repos = NULL, type = "source")
# or with remotes, installed first with install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("phyllype/BreedingR")
# or from a local clone, giving the folder that holds DESCRIPTION
install.packages("C:/path/to/BreedingR", repos = NULL, type = "source")

library(BreedingR)
packageVersion("BreedingR")   # the examples here need 0.4.0.9000
```

The CI installs the package both ways from GitHub on every push and runs the quick start
with the installed copy. To update on Windows, first close every R session that loaded
BreedingR, RStudio included. Windows locks the DLL of a loaded package, and the install
stops with "cannot remove earlier installation".

## Quick start

A complete run on data the package simulates itself, paste and go:

```r
library(BreedingR)
s <- simulate_breeding(n_founders = 60, n_generations = 3,
                       offspring_per_generation = 600, h2 = 0.4,
                       seed = 1)                        # pedigree + phenotypes, 1,860 animals

q  <- qc_phenotypes(s$data, "y", classes = "cg")        # flag, count, never drop silently

fit <- model(y ~ cg + animal(id), q$data, s$pedigree)
fit                                # components, SEs, share of the phenotypic variance
h2(fit)                            # the var(animal) share; 4 var(sire) / Vp in a sire model
head(solutions(fit, s$pedigree))   # id, ebv, se, acc, sorted by breeding value
accuracy(fit, s$pedigree)[1:5]     # prior 1+F, or the G* diagonal if genotyped
cor(ebv(fit)[names(s$tbv)], s$tbv) # against the simulator's own truth
```

## What it fits

One engine, and the formula terms choose the model. Each group below says what kind of
data it is for, names the fitter, shows a minimal call and one result on simulated data.
[The map of models and terms](https://phyllype.github.io/BreedingR/articles/models.html#the-map)
lists every term with its options.

### Animal model, repeatability and direct-maternal

One record or repeated records per animal, with a pedigree. A maternal effect enters as a
second term of the same covariance group, so the direct-maternal correlation is estimated.

```r
model(weight ~ cg + animal(id) + pe(id), data, ped)
model(weight ~ cg + animal(id, group = "g") + maternal(dam, group = "g") + pe(dam), data, ped)
```

  <img src="man/figures/README-animal.svg" width="100%" alt="Accuracy of each animal against its number of offspring with a record, and the components of a direct-maternal fit against the simulated values">
</picture>

*Left: the accuracy of each animal's breeding value against its offspring with a record.
Right: a direct-maternal fit, each component with its 95% interval beside the value
simulated.* [More details](https://phyllype.github.io/BreedingR/articles/models.html#animal-model-repeatability-direct-maternal-and-sire-models)

### Random regression and reaction norms

Records along a continuous axis: an environmental gradient for a reaction norm, or time.
The regression is a formula term on a Legendre basis.

- `model()` with `rn(id, base = )`: a random regression of each animal on the basis
- `h2_curve()` and `plot()`: the heritability along the axis

```r
d <- cbind(d, legendre(d$thi, order = 1, limits = c(60, 84)))
fit <- model(y ~ cg + rn(id, base = c("phi0", "phi1")) + pe(id), d, ped)
h2_curve(fit, limits = c(60, 84))
```

*Left: the genetic reaction norms of 50 animals; the best animal at the cool end is not
the best at the hot end. Right: `h2_curve()` against the simulated heritability.*
[More details](https://phyllype.github.io/BreedingR/articles/models.html#random-regression-and-reaction-norms)

### Several traits

Traits recorded on the same animals, with a full residual covariance and a missing trait
handled record by record: `model_mt()`, and `rg()` for each genetic correlation. For many
environments of one trait, `pegs()` fits a model of the markers, with uncorrelated
residuals between environments.

```r
fit <- model_mt(cbind(y1, y2, y3, y4) ~ cg + animal(id), d, ped)
rg(fit, "animal", "y1", "y2")
```

animals: estimated against simulated genetic correlations.*
[More details](https://phyllype.github.io/BreedingR/articles/models.html#several-traits)

### Bayesian: `gibbs()`

`gibbs()` samples the same models in several chains, and `mcmc_diagnostics()` gives R-hat
and the effective sample sizes. `gibbs(family = "probit")` samples a binary trait on its
liability.

```r
gb <- gibbs(y ~ cg + animal(id), d, ped, n_iter = 20000, chains = 3)
mcmc_diagnostics(gb)
```

[the priors](https://phyllype.github.io/BreedingR/articles/choices.html#the-priors-of-gibbs)

### Genomics: single step, APY, ssSNPBLUP

Genotypes are an argument of the same fit. `genotypes =` turns A into H, `apy_core =`
approximates the inverse of G when the genotyped set is large, `snp_blup()`
solves the single step with the markers as equations and never forms G, and
`snp_effects()` backsolves the marker effects from a fit.

```r
fit <- model(y ~ cg + animal(id), d, ped, genotypes = list(ids = gids, m = M), apy_core = "auto")
snp_effects(fit, ped, genotypes = list(ids = gids, m = M))
```

frequencies.*

### Selection decisions

`selection_index()` combines the breeding values of several traits with weights, and
`rank_drift()` tells how much a new evaluation reorders the candidates.

```r
idx <- selection_index(cbind(y1 = ebv1, y2 = ebv2), weights = c(y1 = 1, y2 = 1))
rank_drift(ebv(old_fit), ebv(new_fit), top = 100)
```

  <img src="man/figures/README-selection.svg" width="100%" alt="Ranks of the candidates before and after the records of their progeny, and the animals that a two-trait selection index selects">
</picture>

*Left: the old top 100 of 4,000 candidates after the records of their progeny; 80 of them
stay in the new top 100. Right: the top 10% by an index of two traits with equal weights.*

### Diagnostics and data checks

Before a fit, `qc_phenotypes()` and `qc_genotypes()` flag problems and delete nothing, and
`parentage_check()` tests each parent against its offspring. Every
fitter reads the structure of the design and stops, or warns, with what to do. After the
fit, `residuals()` gives the conditional, standardized, marginal and Pearson residuals,
and `mcmc_diagnostics()` checks the chains.

```r
qc_phenotypes(d, "y", classes = "cg")
residuals(fit, type = "standardized")
mcmc_diagnostics(gb)
```

## In progress

- autoregressive models for the prediction of breeding values;
- indirect (social) genetic effects, including Bayesian ones;
- non-additive genetic effects;
- categorical traits and time to failure;
- growth curves fitted to repeated weighings;
- diagnostics of residuals and of the data structure.

## Under the hood

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="man/figures/README-sparse-dark.svg">
  <img src="man/figures/README-sparse.svg" width="100%" alt="Nonzero pattern of A-inverse for 180 simulated animals and of its Cholesky factor, in pedigree order and after the minimum degree ordering">
</picture>

*A-inverse of a simulated pedigree of 180 animals and its Cholesky factor, fill-in in
amber. In pedigree order the factor fills in to 11,961 nonzeros; after the minimum degree
ordering, 1,142.*

The mixed model equations are assembled sparse and factored by a sparse Cholesky after a
minimum degree ordering; the variance components come from AI-REML, and `converged`
takes both a small relative step and a Newton decrement under tolerance. The layout unit
is the covariance group, not the term, which is why direct-maternal and the reaction norm
have no fitter of their own.

## How this was validated

Nothing here is checked against itself: each piece answers to an independent path, such
as the dense V form, central finite differences, recovery of simulated components or the
published examples of Mrode and Pocrnic (2023), and the tests in `tests/testthat` run
these comparisons on every build.
